# SmartContactManager
This project is based on java programming language tool i.e springboot. Other than this in this project i used thymeleaf to create
good looking UI with the help of Bootstrap and css little bit.
In this project user can create his/her own account and can manage contacts.(i.e Create new, update existing, delete contact or check how
many contacts are there). 
In this project for security purpose i used spring security with springboot and jwt i.e jsonwebtokens and BCrypt for encryption and 
decrption password.
This project is an example of MVC Architecture (Model, View & Controller) with REST web services.
